# archetype
This is my biggest personal project. It's in a *very early* stage of development, i've a lot of work to do. My main goal here is to have fun and learn a few things here and there on the way.

***Features***
- *GraphQL API w/ Apollo Server/Client*
- *Express server*
- *UI built w/ React*

*I might switch to Next.js in the future, i think it's gonna make a few things easier.*

The project is currently being hosted on *Heroku*, and is accessible via [this link](https://archetypeofficial.herokuapp.com).
